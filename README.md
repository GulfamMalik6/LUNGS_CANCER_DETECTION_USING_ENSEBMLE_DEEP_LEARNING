Lung Cancer Detection Using Ensemble Deep Learning Models

Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, as it significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project explores an ensemble approach to detect lung cancer at an early stage using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on Computed Tomography (CT) images.
Problem Statement

Traditional methods for lung cancer detection often suffer from low accuracy and high rates of false positives and negatives. The goal of this research is to develop a deep learning model that not only improves the accuracy of lung cancer detection but also reduces computational requirements and training time.
Dataset

The dataset used in this research consists of CT scan images of lungs. Initially, the dataset contained 1,190 images, but through augmentation techniques, the dataset was expanded to approximately 7,200 images. This augmentation was crucial for enhancing the model's generalizability and robustness.

Methodology

Model Architecture

The proposed solution employs an ensemble of three distinct CNN architectures. The models are trained separately on the same dataset, and their predictions are combined using a soft voting mechanism. This ensemble approach leverages the strengths of each model while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

    CNN Model 2: Brief description of the second CNN architecture.
    CNN Model 3: Brief description of the third CNN architecture.

Training Process

The training process was conducted with the following key parameters:

    Batch Size: [Specify batch size]
    Epochs: 10 epochs were found to be sufficient for convergence.
    Optimizer: [Specify the optimizer used, e.g., Adam]
    Loss Function: [Specify the loss function used]

Ensemble Strategy

The ensemble model combines the predictions of the three CNNs using a soft voting technique, where the probability scores from each model are averaged to make the final prediction. This approach has been shown to increase accuracy and reduce the likelihood of false positives and negatives.

Results

The ensemble model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.9% on the validation dataset. This performance surpasses many existing methods in the literature, which often require more epochs and complex architectures to achieve similar results.
Comparative Analysis

The model's efficiency is highlighted by its ability to achieve high accuracy with only 10 epochs, compared to other models such as FocalNeXt, which required 40 epochs. The ensemble method's superior performance is evident in both sensitivity and specificity metrics, which are crucial for early-stage detection.

Performance Metrics

    Accuracy: 99.9%
    Sensitivity: [Specify sensitivity]
    Specificity: [Specify specificity]
    F1 Score: [Specify F1 Score]
    ROC Curve: The ROC curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, with an area under the curve (AUC) close to 1.0, indicating excellent performance.

Conclusion

The research demonstrates that using an ensemble of CNNs can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of lung cancer detection from CT images. The model not only achieved state-of-the-art accuracy but also did so with greater computational efficiency. The results suggest that this approach could be a valuable tool in clinical settings for early lung cancer diagnosis.
